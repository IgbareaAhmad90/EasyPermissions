    <string name="title">Information</string>

    <string name="information">Each Android app operates in a process sandbox, apps must
        explicitly request access to resources and data outside their sandbox. If the device
        is running Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher, and the app\'s targetSdkVersion is 23
        or higher, the app requests permissions from the user at run-time.

        \n\nHowever, Android requires that these request come from an Activity. With Easy Permissions
        this is no longer an issue, you may request permission from anywhere as long as you provide
        context. In addition if you request a permission that is already granted the user will not
        be prompted.
